# Towards a Self Healing Runtime for Go

## Vision Statement

Concurrency is a core feature of the Go programming language, enabling developers to efficiently utilize multi-core processors. However, common concurrency issues such as deadlocks, race conditions, and goroutine leaks can severely impact system reliability. The goal of this project is to first develop a deep understanding of Go’s concurrency model, benchmark different concurrency mechanisms, and ultimately build a self-healing runtime tool capable of detecting and recovering from concurrency issues dynamically.

## Goals & Objectives

- Gain proficiency in Go’s concurrency model, including goroutines, channels, and synchronization primitives.
- Benchmark the performance of different concurrency mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, channels, atomic operations).
- Develop an automated system to detect and recover from concurrency issues like deadlocks, race conditions, and goroutine leaks.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of the self-healing runtime through empirical analysis.

## Project Plan

### Phase 1: Learn Go Programming Language

### Phase 2: Learning Go’s Concurrency Model
- Goroutines
- Channels (buffered and unbuffered)
- Implement simple programs to understand common pitfalls such as race conditions, deadlocks, and starvation.

### Phase 3: Benchmarking Go’s Concurrency Mechanisms
- Develop a benchmarking suite
- Goroutine scheduling behavior under high contention
- Impact of goroutine leaks on memory usage

### Phase 4: Designing a Self-Healing Runtime
- **Deadlock Detection & Recovery**
  - Use timeouts and forced unlocking strategies to resolve deadlocks
- **Goroutine Leak Detection**
- Implement the self-healing runtime as a Go library.
