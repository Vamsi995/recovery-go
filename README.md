# Are Your Go Routines Treated Unfairly?

This project investigates fairness in the Go runtime scheduler and proposes modifications to improve scheduling for long-running goroutines. Our modifications introduce alternative scheduling policies to address starvation issues in Go's concurrency model.

## üìå Overview

The Go runtime scheduler is responsible for efficiently distributing goroutines across logical processors. However, we observed that long-running goroutines can suffer from starvation when preempted and placed back into the global run queue. This project presents scheduling enhancements to mitigate unfair scheduling and improve overall performance.

## üöÄ Modifications to the Go Runtime

We propose three key modifications to Go‚Äôs scheduling mechanism:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Cyclic Swapping of Go Routines**
- Instead of placing preempted goroutines in the global run queue, they are passed to the next logical processor‚Äôs local queue.
- This reduces contention for the global queue and ensures preempted goroutines resume execution without waiting for an empty local queue.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Phase Splitting of Processors**
- Logical processors are divided into two groups:
  - One group processes short-running goroutines.
  - The other processes long-running goroutines.
- Short-running goroutines transition into the long-running group upon preemption, ensuring a balanced workload distribution.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Phase Splitting with Differential Preemption**
- Introduces a variable time slice:
  - Short-running processors maintain a standard 10ms time slice.
  - Long-running processors have an extended time slice (20ms).
- This reduces excessive preemption for long-running tasks, improving overall execution efficiency.

## üîç Experimental Setup

- We categorized workloads into **short-running** and **long-running** goroutines based on execution duration.
- We analyzed scheduler traces using the Go `trace` tool to observe scheduling patterns.
- Three workloads were tested: 
  - Simple loops
  - Fibonacci computation
  - Matrix multiplication

## üìä Findings

- The default Go scheduler can cause long-running goroutines to starve when short-running goroutines dominate the local queues.
- Our modified scheduler significantly reduces average wait times and improves fairness for long-running workloads.
- We identified additional Go runtime tuning parameters such as `schedtick`, `timeslice`, and `work stealing batch size` that can further refine performance.

## üîß How to Build & Run

1. Clone the Go source code:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/golang/go.git

2. Install the Go compiler from go.dev.

3. Replace the following files with our modified versions:

- ```src/runtime/runtime2.go```

- ```src/runtime/proc.go```

```sh
cp path/to/modified/runtime2.go go/src/runtime/
cp path/to/modified/proc.go go/src/runtime/
```

4. Set up the custom Go runtime:

```sh
export GOROOT=/path/to/custom/go
export PATH=$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
```
5. Run your Go programs using:

```sh
go run your_program.go
```

Yup this works like magic, no need to manually build the whole sourcefile using ```./make.bash``` from the src directory.
